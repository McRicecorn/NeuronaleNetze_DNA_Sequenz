1:
Load the dataset, inspect its structure and dimensions, and briefly describe its content.

2:
Transform the data into a form suitable for MLP input:
– Convert to numpy / torch tensors
– Flatten or reshape inputs as needed
– Split into training and test sets

3:
Define an appropriate MLP architecture (e.g with PyTorch nn.Sequential). Include number of layers, activation functions, and output dimensions. Report structure and number of parameters

4:
Implement a full training loop including:
– Loss function and optimizer
– Iterative training with loss updates
– Plot the loss history

5:
Generate predictions on the test set and compute suitable metrics:
– Regression: MSE or R²
– Classification: overall accuracy and class-wise metrices

6:
Plot training and validation loss curves, and visualize model results e.g. predicted vs. true values, or confusion matrices.

7:
Provide a short reflection on model behavior and performance.
